# 👟 Sneaker Sales Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing sneaker sales data using **MySQL** to uncover meaningful business insights related to sales performance, customer behavior, product trends, and supplier impact. It demonstrates how SQL can be leveraged to solve real-world data problems and support decision-making in a retail environment.

The analysis is structured into three core areas:

- **Sales Performance**: Evaluates total sales volume, store and regional performance, best-selling product categories, and monthly trends to help understand business growth and seasonality.
- **Customer and Product Analysis**: Investigates customer purchasing patterns, most frequently bought products, customer distribution by geography, and repeat customer behavior.
- **Supplier and Product Performance**: Assesses supplier contributions to sales volume and value, diversity of products supplied, category specialization, and unit price comparisons.

This project is a practical demonstration of how raw transactional data can be transformed into strategic insights using SQL, and is ideal for showcasing skills in data analytics, reporting, and business intelligence.
